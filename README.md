# Spark-Essentials
Basic spark operations with a small application at the end allowing digesting big amounts of data for a taxi company (app. 35 GB).

This repo was created based on the course provided by RockTheJVM. Its aim is to demonstrate skills and knowledge gained during its participation.

Mentioned above application was tested on a local machine, as well as, on AWS EMR cluster to compare performance and to get a taste of cloud computing.
